# Market Microservices

This repository contains a set of simple microservices designed to explore and compare different architectural patterns in a practical context.

The project was built with a strong educational focus, aiming to demonstrate **pure and uncompromised implementations** of each architectural style in a microservices environment.

## Microservices Overview

- **Product Microservice**  
  Implemented using the **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**.  

- **Sales Microservice**  
  Developed with the principles of **Clean Architecture**.  

- **Purchase Microservice**  
  Built using a **Layered Architecture** with a strong emphasis on **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**.  

## Key Principles

- Each service follows a **purist implementation** of its respective architecture pattern.
- Business logic is decoupled from infrastructure and frameworks wherever possible.

## Purpose

This project serves as a learning tool for understanding:
- Microservices design and boundaries
- Practical application of architectural patterns
- Trade-offs and advantages of each approach
